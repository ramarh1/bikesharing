## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to create visualizations on Tableau that helps answer important business questions related to Bike sharing usage, who uses it, and when they use it. For example, the story includes the top ending location of bike riders, gender breakdown of bike usage, as well as how long users use the bike for. The goal is to provide visual information related to Citibike user data.

## Results

Description: This visualization shows the checkout time for Citibike users. The highest point would be the most common trip duration, which is 5 minutes.

Description: As depicted by the graph, there are more male users than female users, and their checkout times or trip durations are mostly 5 and 6 minutes, respectively. The trip duration for unknown gender varies from 10-20 minutes.

Description: This is a visualization of trips by weekday per hour. We can see that busiest time is 5pm-7pm on Thursday.

![Sheet 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88624677/145422309-180cb329-4c85-4ca6-a9d0-592b65769c22.png)
Description: This is similar to the previous visualization but with a gender breakdown. Looking at the female and male gender, we can see that the busiest time for both genders is still 5pm-7 pm on Thursday.

![Sheet 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88624677/145422368-722bc136-4f42-4648-a832-2c828d7a0eec.png)
Description: In the User Trips by Gender by Weekday visualization, we can see that male subscribers use the service the most on Thursday and Friday. Whereas female subscribers use the service Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but to a lesser extent.

![Sheet 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88624677/145422395-e660a54f-35aa-45a9-ac9f-4164baa7a5ab.png)
Description: In the Gender Breakdown visualization, it is apparent that the bike sharing service is mostly used by males, a signifcant number of around 1,500,000 users. On the other hand, about 500,000 users are female.

![Sheet 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88624677/145422474-b7633aa9-db54-4f8b-ab1e-3551a71a3778.png)
Description: This visualization shows us the most common ending locations for users in the New York City area. The areas that are highly frequented are possibly where there are the most tourists who use the bike sharing app to get around.


## Summary
The results show us that we have mostly male subscribers who use the bike sharing app, the common duration for these trips is five minutes, and that the most busy time is 5pm-7pm on Thursday and also Friday. We could do a visualization that shows the top starting locations for customers who are not subscribed, to see if the locations are in tourist areas. Another future visualization could be checkout times for customers vs. subscribers.
